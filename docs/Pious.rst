Introduction
============

A python package for dealing with basic input/output processes. Pious came from
the observation that the processing data almost always boils down to a series
of discreet transforms. Splitting these transforms out into reusable modules is
not only a useful way to build data processing pipelines but also provide a
convenient way to design and describe the process to others.

Pious aims to provide the tools needed to build complex data transformation
pipeline in a simple and easily understood manner. It also try to provide the
tools necessary to inspect data as it passes through the pipeline to make
debugging processes as easy as possible.
